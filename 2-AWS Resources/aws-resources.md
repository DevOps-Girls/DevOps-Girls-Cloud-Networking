# AWS Resources Used in Cloud Networking

Descriptions and Examples for the following AWS Resources:

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
CIDR Range
Subnets
Internet Gateway (IGW)
NAT Gateway
Direct Connect/VPN
VPC Peering
Route Table
Network Access Control List (NACL)



<details><summary>What is a VPC?</summary><p>

### Here's a short list of areas in your career where good whiteboarding skills are really helpful:

- Virtual Private Cloud
- Create a virtual networking environment
- Isolated section of your AWS services - keeps your stuff contained

It’s customisable:
- Private and public access (depending on what you’re architecting)
- IP ranges
- Security controls - NACL
- Connect to on premises infra via VPN/Direct connect - hybrid cloud
- Route Table
- Connect it to the internet or on premises infra
- NAT gateway - bastion/jumpbox
- VPC Peering (no transitive peering, you have to be explicit)

Your VPC sits inside a Region. Subnets sit inside a VPC.

NOTE: Your free AWS account comes with a default VPC and we’re going to create a custom VPC.
