# Deploy an App into your Network

### Creating resources with Serverless
Now, we're going to deploy an app with [Serverless](https://serverless.com/). If you have node installed, you can install Serverless with `npm install -g serverless`. Check [here](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) or ask if you need help.

We'll be reusing the todo app from a [previous bootcamp](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/DevOps-Girls-Serverless--Bootcamp-4/tree/master/serverless-starter-todo) for this, so if you need an introduction to Serverless, check it out! 
We're going to make a number of resources for this app-
1. An IAM role for the Lambda to access your Dynamo table
2. A Lambda 
3. An API Gateway
4. An S3 Bucket
5. A policy about who can access the S3 bucket (everyone!)
6. And a DynamoDB table 

If you're not familiar with any of these resources, check out the previous bootcamp, or ask one of the helpers!

We're going to start with the following template:
```yml
service: serverless-starter-todo

provider:
  name: aws
  region: ${opt:region, 'ap-southeast-2'}
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stackName: serverless-starter-todo-${self:provider.stage}
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'dev'}
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - dynamodb:DeleteItem
        - dynamodb:PutItem
        - dynamodb:Scan
      Resource:
        Fn::Join:
          - ''
          - - 'arn:aws:dynamodb:'
            - Ref: AWS::Region
            - ':'
            - Ref: AWS::AccountId
            - :table/
            - Ref: DatabaseTable

functions:
  TodoApi:
    name: serverless-starter-todo-api-${self:provider.stage}
    handler: index.handler
    environment:
      TABLE_NAME:
        Ref: DatabaseTable
    events:
      - http:
          cors: true
          method: any
          path: /{proxy+}
    vpc:
      # Replace the curly brackets!
      {}

resources:
  Resources:
    WebsiteBucket:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
        WebsiteConfiguration:
          IndexDocument: index.html
    WebsiteBucketPolicy:
      Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
      Properties:
        PolicyDocument:
          Version: '2012-10-17'
          Statement:
            - Action: s3:GetObject
              Effect: Allow
              Principal: '*'
              Resource:
                Fn::Join:
                  - ''
                  - - 'arn:aws:s3:::'
                    - Ref: WebsiteBucket
                    - /*
        Bucket:
          Ref: WebsiteBucket
    DatabaseTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: id
            AttributeType: S
        BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: id
            KeyType: HASH

  Outputs:
    WebsiteBucketName:
      Value:
        Ref: WebsiteBucket
    WebsiteURL:
      Value:
        Fn::GetAtt:
          - WebsiteBucket
          - WebsiteURL
```

To get the template, run the following command:
```bash
serverless create --template-url https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/DevOps-Girls-Cloud-Networking/tree/serverless-template/app

# Serverless: Generating boilerplate...
# Serverless: Downloading and installing "serverless-starter-todo"...
# Serverless: Successfully installed "serverless-starter-todo"

cd serverless-starter-todo
```

This creates your app! However, don't deploy it just yet- this will get deployed to the default VPC in your account, not the one you've created. We want your VPC deployed into the private subnets of your new VPC. Add to this the following, in the VPC section of youe `TodoApi`:
```yml
securityGroupIds:
  - [Replace this with the ID of your security group]
subnetIds:
  - [Replace this with the ID of your private subnet]
```
You can find the ID of your private subnet and the security group (you can use the one you made for your EC2) in the AWS console. Deploy your app:
```yml
serverless deploy --verbose
```

And your app will be created! You can check it with the `WebsiteURL` output by Serverless. Change the value in `Set API URL` on the website to the value of `ServiceEndpoint` output by Serverless. 

Check the `Network` section of your Lambda function (`Serverless>Lambda>serverless-starter-todo-api-dev`) to see that your app is in the correct VPC. 

Congratulations! Your app is now in your VPC. 

If you're having trouble with your YAML (it can be hard to get the spacing right) below is a copy of what your final YAML should look like (you'll still need to update the IDs):
