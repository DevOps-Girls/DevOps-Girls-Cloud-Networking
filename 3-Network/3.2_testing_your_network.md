# Testing Your Network

By the end of this session you'll have:
  1. An EC2 in your public subnet
  2. An EC2 in your private subnet
  3. A way to remotely access your public EC2 instance using SSM
  4. A way to removely access your private EC2 instance via your public EC2 instance

###ğŸš€ Launch an EC2 instance into your public subnet
We're going to deploy an EC2 instance into our public subnet create in the previous session. This EC2 will have access to the internet and will also be able to accept incoming connections from the internet.

Follow these steps to create the EC2 to be deployed in the __public__ subnet:

1. From the Console, go to Services > Compute > EC2 > Launch Instance
   ![launch instance](images/3.2.1-launch-instance.png)
   note: ensure your region is still set to Sydney
2. Choose *Amazon Linux 2 AMI* > t2.micro
   ![select ami](images/3.2.2-select-ami.png)
3. Click *Next: Configure Instance Details*
   ![select type](images/3.2.3-select-insance-type.png)
4. Select the cloud-networking-bootcamp VPC and the associated public subnet
   ![select vpc](images/3.2.4-select-vpc.png)
   ![select subnet](images/3.2.5-select-subnet.png)
5. Ensure that "Auto-assign Public IP" is set to "Enable"
6. Assign the IAM role created earlier with SSM permissions
   ![select iam](images/3.2.6-select-iam.png)
7. Next until you get to *Configure Security Group* > Create new Security Group
8. Security Group name: __public-sg__
9.  Add rule > Type: HTTP (port 80)
10. Review and Launch 
    ![create sg](images/3.2.7-create-sg.png)
11. Launch the instance
    ![launch instance](images/3.2.8-launch.png)
12. When the popup appears, select "proceed without a key pair", then click "Launce Instances"
    ![no key pair](images/3.2.9-without-keypair.png)


###ğŸš€ Launch an EC2 instance into your private subnet
Follow these steps to create the EC2 to be deployed in the __private__ subnet, note there are some differences!

1. Follow steps 1-3 above for deploying an EC2 into your public subnet
4. Select the cloud-networking-bootcamp VPC and the associated private subnet
  ![select subnet](images/3.2.10-select-subnet-private.png)
5. Next until you get to *Configure Security Group* > Choose an exisiting Security Group
6. Select the *Default* security group
  ![default sg](images/3.2.11-default-sg.png)
7. Review and Launch > Launch
8. Create a *new* Key pair > Key pair name: __cloud-networking-bootcamp__
  ![keypair](images/3.2.12-create-keypair.png)


Note: You can name your instances as *public* and *private* to make the next steps easier ğŸ¤”
