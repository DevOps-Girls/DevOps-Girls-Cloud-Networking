# Deploying Simple Webservers

We're going to deploy 2 webservers, webserver A and webserver B. The intent is that we will be able to hit a public end point and see the load being balanced between the webservers.

### 🚀 Launch 2 EC2 instance into your private subnet

1. Services > Compute > EC2 > Launch Instance
2. Choose *Amazon Linux 2 AMI* > t2.micro
3. Click *Next: Configure Instance Details*
4. Select the cloud-networking-bootcamp VPC and the associated public subnet
5. Next until you get to *Configure Security Group* > Create new Security Group
6. Security Group name: __public-sg__
7. Add rule > Type: HTTP (port 80)
8. Add rule > Type: SSH (port 80)
9. Review and Launch > Launch
10. Create a new keypair > Key pair name: __cloud-networking-bootcamp__

🔁 Repeat these steps!

🌈 Woo hoo! You have created 2 EC2 Instances! 🌈

### Setting up your EC2 Instance as a Web Server
This will require SSHing into your instance using SSM!




Make sure you have the right priviledges:

`sudo su`

Update your OS

`yum update -y`

Install an Apache server

`yum install httpd -y`

Start your web server

`service httpd start`

This command just makes sure your web server restarts if it stops

`chkconfig httpd on`

Let's edit our web server!

`cd /var/www/html`

if you `ls` you'll see an `index.html` file, we're going to edit this...

You can open `index.html` in nano:

`nano index.html`

This is the code we want in that file:

`<html><body>Hello from Web Server A!</body></html>`

Save and Exit nano

🔁 Repeat these steps for your 2nd EC2 instance (Web Server B), but change your index.html file to be `<html><body>Hello from Web Server B!</body></html>`




🌈 Woo hoo! You have made your EC2 Webservers! 🌈


### Let's now test our load balancer
